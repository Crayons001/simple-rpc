Implementation of RPC using Python xml rpc

Instruction:
Using any Remote Procedure Call library, create two programs P and Q, as client and sever respectively. Implement 3 procedures in Q that can be called remotely from P as follows.

    One procedure accepts an integer, increments it and returns the result.
    Another procedure accepts a floating point and an integer, squares the floating point and adds the integer and then returns the result.
    The third procedure accepts a string, reverse it and returns the result.
